# NEXT-GEN Development Stack

üê≥ Dockerized Strapi & Next.js Setup

## Description

This project provides a Dockerized setup for a Strapi and Next.js application. It enables you to quickly deploy and run a Strapi backend and Next.js frontend together using Docker containers. It also includes an NGINX reverse proxy container for routing requests to the appropriate services.

## Features

‚ú® Easily deploy a Strapi and Next.js application with Docker.

‚ú® Simplifies the setup process for running both backend and frontend together.

‚ú® Includes an NGINX reverse proxy for routing requests.

‚ú® Encourages a consistent development and deployment environment.

## Requirements

‚öôÔ∏è Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.

‚öôÔ∏è nginxproxy/nginx-proxy: Ensure you have the `nginxproxy/nginx-proxy` Docker container running in the background to handle reverse proxying.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Dockerized Strapi & Next.js setup, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/balatD/strapi-next-docker
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```shell
cd strapi-next-docker
```

3. Rename the .example.env file:

```shell

```

4. Change the necessary variables inside .env:

```dotenv
PROJECT_NAME=
PROJECT_URL=
```

5. Change the `server_name` in `conf/nginx/default.conf` to the same URL used in `PROJECT_URL`:

6. Start the containers with the ./start.sh bash script:
